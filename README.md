With the prevalence of smart phone cameras and other mobile camera devices, image processing has become an important focus area for research.  Without the benefit of large, expensive optics and controls, mobile cameras must increasingly solve problems computationally. Modern mobile cameras use image processing algorithms for every step of the imaging process - helping users to automatically focus on objects during image capture and also enhance images via post processing after they are stored. Third party applications such as Instagram have gained enormous popularity from their ability to quickly turn ordinary photographs into works of art through creative use of image filtering. Since image processing has become so ubiquitous, it is important that the supporting algorithms as as efficient as possible.  In this paper, we will discuss one of the more basic forms of image processing - the application of a convolution matrix or kernel to an image. In particular, we shall explore the possibilities of speeding up the convolution process by 1) using multiple threads on different CPU cores and 2) exploiting even more parallelism using an FPGA.
